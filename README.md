# Joying-RootAssistant

WARNING: Only for joying Intel 3GR head units.

Note: Windows users can better download the zip. For some reason the adb.exe gives and "access refused" error when downloading the repository using git.

Currently this repository only contains the SuperSU install scripts, the busybox upgrade scripts and 3 modded versions of the radio app. 

## SuperSU_for_Joying_Intel
The Joying units are rooted but miss a user-friendly Superuser apk that deals with the SELinux policies on your unit.
These scripts can be found in the SuperSU_for_Joying_Intel folder.

## busybox-X86
The busybox version on the Joying head units is relatively old and buggy. The scripts in the busybox-X86 folder will update the busybox version on your system.

## Radio Mods
The standard layout of the Joying radio app is not very nice. These mods contain 4 versions of a changed layout.


-----
This repo should grow in time to contain sets of scripts and an apk to simplify adding/removing/modifying apks on your Joying unit.
